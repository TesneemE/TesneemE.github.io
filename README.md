## About
Welcome to my webpage. My name is Tesneem Essa and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science at Hunter College. I am currently a CUNY Tech Prep Fellow in the Data Science track and hope to pursue a career pertaining to this feild. My interest in data analytics lies in it's ability to be a means of understanding and solving societal issues. As such, I have previously worked on a project that used Python and OpenData to look into and analyze affordable housing in NYC. I am a problem solver at heart and hope that I am never too comfortable in this career, that there is always something I can remain curious and puzzled by.
